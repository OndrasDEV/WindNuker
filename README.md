# About The Project
Wind Nuker is a lightweight app made in Python using the library discord-webhook.
# How to Install
Installation is suprisingly easy, you need only few things to run this!
First, you need to install the latest python from https://www.python.org/
After that you need to run your cmd or Windows Terminal and run the following command:pip install -r requirements.txt
Its important to run this command in the same folder as all the files in this repository!
If you did all correctly then you can proceed to execute the code with command: python main.py
Again, its important to be run in the same folder as this repository.
